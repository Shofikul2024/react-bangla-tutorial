### **React: Extracting State Logic into a Reducer**

In React, **state logic** refers to how you handle state updates based on user actions or other triggers. When this logic becomes complex (like managing multiple states or actions), you can **extract it into a reducer** for better organization and maintainability.

---

### **What is a Reducer?**

- A **reducer** is a function that takes two arguments:
  1. **Current State**: The state before the update.
  2. **Action**: An object describing what needs to change (e.g., `{ type: "increment", payload: 1 }`).
- The reducer returns the **new state** based on the action.

Reducers are commonly used with the `useReducer` hook in React, especially for managing **complex state logic**.

---

### **Why Use a Reducer?**

- **Centralized Logic**: Keeps all state logic in one place.
- **Predictable Updates**: State updates are determined by the reducer, making them easier to debug.
- **Scalability**: Helps manage complex states with multiple actions and updates.

---

### **Steps to Extract State Logic into a Reducer**

#### **1. Identify Complex State Logic**

Check if you have multiple related states or logic thatâ€™s difficult to manage with `useState`.

Example:

- State: A shopping cart with items.
- Logic: Add, remove, or update items.

#### **2. Write a Reducer Function**

Define the reducer function to handle the state logic.

#### **3. Use the `useReducer` Hook**

Replace multiple `useState` hooks with a single `useReducer` hook for managing state.

#### **4. Combine Context Providers**

If youâ€™re using multiple contexts, you can integrate them with reducers for shared state.

---

### **Building a Fundamental App with Two Providers**

Letâ€™s build a simple **shopping app** that:

- Uses two contexts: **UserContext** (user data) and **CartContext** (cart state).
- Extracts state logic for the cart into a reducer.
- Fetches user and product data from external files.

---

### **Step 1: Create the Data Files**

**`userData.js`**

```javascript
export const userData = {
  name: "Md. Mojnu Miah",
  email: "mojnu@example.com",
};
```

**`productData.js`**

```javascript
export const productData = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 500 },
  { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 300 },
  { id: 3, name: "Headphones", price: 100 },
];
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Contexts**

**UserContext.js**

```javascript
import { createContext } from "react";

export const UserContext = createContext();
```

**CartContext.js**

```javascript
import { createContext } from "react";

export const CartContext = createContext();
```

---

### **Step 3: Write a Reducer for the Cart**

**cartReducer.js**

```javascript
export const cartReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_ITEM":
      return [...state, action.payload];
    case "REMOVE_ITEM":
      return state.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`);
  }
};
```

---

In the given reducer code, **`action.payload`** represents the data or information being passed to the reducer along with the action. It is used to update the state based on the action's type.

---

### **Breakdown of `action` Object**

The `action` object has two primary properties:

1. **`type`**: A string that specifies the type of action to perform (e.g., `"ADD_ITEM"` or `"REMOVE_ITEM"`). This determines which case in the `switch` statement will execute.
2. **`payload`**: The actual data being sent to the reducer. This is optional and varies depending on the action type. It carries the information needed to modify the state.

---

### **How `action.payload` Works in This Reducer**

#### 1. **`ADD_ITEM` Case**

```javascript
case "ADD_ITEM":
  return [...state, action.payload];
```

- **What it does**: Adds a new item to the cart.
- **`action.payload`**: Here, it represents the item (e.g., `{ id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 500 }`) being added to the cart.
- **Logic**:
  - The current state (cart) is spread using `...state` to retain existing items.
  - `action.payload` (the new item) is added to the cart array.

---

#### 2. **`REMOVE_ITEM` Case**

```javascript
case "REMOVE_ITEM":
  return state.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload.id);
```

- **What it does**: Removes an item from the cart based on its `id`.
- **`action.payload`**: Here, it represents the item to be removed. Specifically, it contains the `id` of the item, like `{ id: 1 }`.
- **Logic**:
  - `state.filter(...)` iterates over the current cart.
  - It excludes the item whose `id` matches `action.payload.id`.

---

### **Example of `action.payload` in Action**

Letâ€™s see how `action.payload` is used when dispatching actions.

#### Adding an Item

```javascript
dispatch({
  type: "ADD_ITEM",
  payload: { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 500 },
});
```

- **`type`**: `"ADD_ITEM"` instructs the reducer to add an item.
- **`payload`**: `{ id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 500 }` is the new item to be added to the cart.

Resulting State:

```javascript
[
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 500 }, // The new item added
];
```

---

#### Removing an Item

```javascript
dispatch({
  type: "REMOVE_ITEM",
  payload: { id: 1 },
});
```

- **`type`**: `"REMOVE_ITEM"` instructs the reducer to remove an item.
- **`payload`**: `{ id: 1 }` specifies the item to remove by its `id`.

Resulting State:

```javascript
[]; // The item with id: 1 is removed from the cart
```

---

### **Summary**

- **`action.payload`** is the data carried by an action to provide context for updating the state.
- Its structure and content depend on the action type.
- The reducer uses **`action.payload`** to update the state predictably based on the action logic.

### **Step 4: Create Providers**

**UserProvider.js**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { UserContext } from "./UserContext";
import { userData } from "../data/userData";

const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={userData}>{children}</UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default UserProvider;
```

**CartProvider.js**

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "./CartContext";
import { cartReducer } from "../reducers/cartReducer";

const CartProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [cart, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, []); // Initial state is an empty array

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={{ cart, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default CartProvider;
```

---

### Why We Use `useReducer` in `CartProvider`

We use `useReducer` in `CartProvider` to **manage complex state logic** in a predictable and organized way. Specifically in this code, the `useReducer` hook is used to handle the state of the cart (an array of items) and the logic for actions like **adding items** and **removing items**.

This makes the code more scalable, maintainable, and easy to test, especially when state transitions involve multiple steps or actions.

---

### **Code Explanation (Step by Step)**

#### **1. Import Statements**

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "./CartContext";
import { cartReducer } from "../reducers/cartReducer";
```

- **`useReducer`**: React's hook for managing state with a reducer function.
- **`CartContext`**: A context object used to share the cart state and dispatcher across the app.
- **`cartReducer`**: The reducer function containing logic to update the cart state based on actions like `"ADD_ITEM"` or `"REMOVE_ITEM"`.

---

#### **2. `useReducer` Hook**

```javascript
const [cart, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, []);
```

- **`cartReducer`**: A function defining how the state changes based on the action (e.g., add or remove an item).
- **Initial State (`[]`)**: The cart starts as an empty array.
- **`cart`**: The current state of the cart (an array of items).
- **`dispatch`**: A function used to send actions to the reducer, triggering state updates.

---

#### **3. Context Provider**

```javascript
<CartContext.Provider value={{ cart, dispatch }}>
  {children}
</CartContext.Provider>
```

- **`CartContext.Provider`**: Wraps the application (or part of it) to provide the cart state and `dispatch` function to child components.
- **`value={{ cart, dispatch }}`**: Exposes:
  - **`cart`**: The current cart state, allowing child components to access and display it.
  - **`dispatch`**: A function that child components can use to trigger cart actions (e.g., adding or removing items).
- **`children`**: Represents the components wrapped by `CartProvider`.

---

### **Why Use `useReducer` Instead of `useState`?**

1. **Centralized State Logic**:

   - `useReducer` moves all state update logic into the `cartReducer` function, keeping components simpler and reducing code duplication.

2. **Complex Actions**:

   - If you were to handle actions like `"ADD_ITEM"` or `"REMOVE_ITEM"` directly with `useState`, you would need to write repetitive code in every component that manipulates the cart. `useReducer` simplifies this by defining all logic in one place.

3. **Scalability**:

   - If more actions are added (e.g., `"CLEAR_CART"`, `"UPDATE_ITEM_QUANTITY"`), the reducer can easily handle them without cluttering components.

4. **Predictable Updates**:
   - `useReducer` ensures that state updates are predictable and follow a consistent pattern: **state + action â†’ new state**.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Why `useReducer`?**  
   To manage cart state with complex logic like adding and removing items in an organized and centralized manner.

2. **How Does It Work Here?**

   - **`cartReducer`** defines the logic for modifying the cart state.
   - **`useReducer`** hooks into the state and logic, providing:
     - **`cart`**: The current state of the cart.
     - **`dispatch`**: A function to trigger state changes.

3. **Why Wrap in Context?**  
   To make `cart` and `dispatch` accessible to all components in the app without passing them as props.

This setup ensures the cart logic is reusable, testable, and easy to extend as the app grows. Let me know if youâ€™d like an example of how to use this `CartProvider` in a component! ðŸ˜Š

### **Step 5: Wrap App with Providers**

**index.js**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import UserProvider from "./contexts/UserProvider";
import CartProvider from "./contexts/CartProvider";

ReactDOM.render(
  <UserProvider>
    <CartProvider>
      <App />
    </CartProvider>
  </UserProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

---

### **Step 6: Consume Contexts in Components**

#### **Header.js**

Display user data from `UserContext`.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { UserContext } from "../contexts/UserContext";

const Header = () => {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <header style={{ padding: "10px", background: "#f0f0f0" }}>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

#### **ProductList.js**

Display products and allow adding them to the cart.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { productData } from "../data/productData";
import { CartContext } from "../contexts/CartContext";

const ProductList = () => {
  const { dispatch } = useContext(CartContext);

  const addToCart = (product) => {
    dispatch({ type: "ADD_ITEM", payload: product });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Products</h2>
      {productData.map((product) => (
        <div key={product.id}>
          <p>
            {product.name} - ${product.price}
          </p>
          <button onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>Add to Cart</button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductList;
```

#### **Cart.js**

Display cart items and allow removing them.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "../contexts/CartContext";

const Cart = () => {
  const { cart, dispatch } = useContext(CartContext);

  const removeFromCart = (item) => {
    dispatch({ type: "REMOVE_ITEM", payload: item });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      {cart.length === 0 ? (
        <p>Your cart is empty.</p>
      ) : (
        cart.map((item) => (
          <div key={item.id}>
            <p>
              {item.name} - ${item.price}
            </p>
            <button onClick={() => removeFromCart(item)}>Remove</button>
          </div>
        ))
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Cart;
```

---

### **Step 7: Combine Everything**

**App.js**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Header from "./components/Header";
import ProductList from "./components/ProductList";
import Cart from "./components/Cart";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <ProductList />
      <Cart />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

### **How It Works**

1. **`useReducer`**: Manages the cart state and logic (add/remove items).
2. **Multiple Contexts**: `UserContext` provides user data, and `CartContext` manages the cart state.
3. **External Data**: `userData` and `productData` are imported and used in components.

---

### **Benefits**

- **Separation of Concerns**: State logic is in the reducer, not spread across components.
- **Scalability**: Multiple providers can work together seamlessly.
- **Reusability**: Reducer and contexts are modular and reusable.
